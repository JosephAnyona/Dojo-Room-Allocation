# Dojo-Room-Allocation

This is the first version of the system including the unittests

The system should

1. create_room <room_type> <room_name>... - Creates rooms in the Dojo. Using this command, the user should be able to create as many        rooms as possible by specifying multiple room names after the create_room command.

2. add_person <person_name> <FELLOW|STAFF> [wants_accommodation] - Adds a person to the system and allocates the person to a random     room. wants_accommodation here is an optional argument which can be either Y or N. The default value if it is not provided is N.
